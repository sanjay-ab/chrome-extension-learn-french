# chrome-extension-learn-french
A simple chrome extension that randomly shows you commonly used french words to help with learning the language.

The 700 or so words were taken from a list on french.languagedaily.com. I may add more functionality to this but for now it remains as a fairly low effort way to learn/remember some words. 

Note that this was made in 2021, so it may not work with current APIs.
